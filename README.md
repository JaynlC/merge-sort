# merge-sort
-----------
-----------
This is a Ruby recursive fundemental project to put into practise recusrion which involves solve sorting an array from lowest to highest number. 

Parameters
---------------------------
Array

Returns
---------------------------
Sorted Array in asceding order. 

Fundementals Employed:
---------------------------
Recursion, array methods, loops. 

What I learnt:
---------------------------
- Learnt adventages of MergeSort O(nlogn) compared to BubbleSort O(n^2). This means Merge sort should run faster than Bubble sort in the worst case scenario. In the best case scenario, O(n^2) (bubblesort) is faster.

- As part of this, I learnt the importance of recursion methods in certain scenario's such as in Mergesort (faster run time, less memory in worst case scenario), or to access deep nested arrays such as accessing family's children in a hash tree.  

- I used CS50 Merge Sort lesson and the psuedocode taught which helped solve the problem.
